# Car Slider

## 60's and 70's American Muscle Cars
This web page presents a carousel showcasing some of the most iconic muscle cars from the 60s and 70s. The basic specs are displayed along with a picture of each car. It is possible to slide through the cards to see the next or previous one by clicking on the arrows on the sides.

## Objective
The main structure of the page was developed by following an online tutorial lesson. During the development of this project, the basic concepts of **HTML** and **CSS** were introduced by the instructors, along with a brief introduction to JavaScript functions.

## Concept
The cards are all listed in the HTML. The currently active card is assigned a class called `selected`, which is styled with 100% opacity using CSS, while the other cards have no opacity set. JavaScript manipulates the list by assigning the `selected` class to the next card and removing it from the previous one. This means the current card disappears while the next one is displayed, depending on the direction of the arrow clicked.
